# 2022 Commissions
> [!fail] Closed since Aug 2nd, 2022.
> â€“ Why was it closed?
> I've quite a few projects that I'd like to get started or continue working on.
> Some before this year ends and one 'till September, and because of the pending comms. and other appointments I can't get enough focus and time for those projects.
> 
> Of course, as soon as I get everything ready and finished, I'll be ready to re-open again.
> 
> Anyway, thanks for the attention.
