# Softwares
- **Obsidian**
For writing almost anything, from short notes to long-term novels and other stories. I'm also using for write and piblish these notes, thanks to @oleeskild's [obsidian-digital-garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden).

- **Medibang Paint** and **FireAlpaca**
My artworks are done in these apps. The main reason for using it is that they have the best portability compared to other ones.
I edit my arts' projects on both tablet ^[Tab S6], smartphone^[J4 Core] and PC^[Gateway (Acer) laptop] thanks to Medibang, which isn't possible with other applications existing like IbisPaint^[Seriously, its UI seems nice but not for tablets or PC.] or Procreate^[No way, I can't and won't afford an iPad just for drawing.].
