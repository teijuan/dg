# About Me

I'm `Tei-Juan`, a 21y. male student, digital/traditional artist.
Talkative on the web but kinda shy irl.

Drawing is my main activity, but I also have some hobbies.

There are many things that I'd like to learn and practice someday, many of them related to drawing, but have no plans for them yet.
